## 0.2.2 - Ingenious patch for accidental closing tags
* Merged PR #5 from @marcofugaro to prevent accidental closing tags within quotes, should fix #2 (Many thanks for this!)

## 0.2.0 - Fork out of necessity
* Forked original autoclose repo due to inactivity and bugs needing to be fixed
* Borrowed regex fix from PR of original repo to fix H1/H2/etc tags
* Fixed unnecessary closings when there is a tag anywhere in the line and you hit the ">" key
* I hate coffeescript :(

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed
