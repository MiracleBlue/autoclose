# autoclose-tags
Autocloses html-like tags in all files when you press the > key that follows an open tag.

Forked from the great original work of [awaw00/autoclose](https://github.com/awaw00/autoclose), out of necessity, since there are bugs to be fixed and there has been no activity on the original repo for many, many months.

## Usage
  * When typing an open tag in any editor (i.e `<div`), when you hit the `>` key, a closing `</div>` will automatically be inserted for you.

Still has a few bugs to be worked out, but at least the major ones should be sorted.  Also, regex shouldn't be used for this.  But whatever.
